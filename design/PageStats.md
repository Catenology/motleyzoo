I've helped with SEO on top pages in the past, plus cleaning up meta tags and open graph tags for things like Facebook which has helped these top pages get more exposure. I know there's a lot more that can be done though. Just thought I'd bring up traffic numbers and what is most important: actually adopting out pets and watching doggie daycare dogs play.


It'd be great if we were able to display donations better, meaning getting people to donate.
